Icon A5
=======

The Icon A5 airplane for Flightgear.

Currently in development; features in the current revision include:

* Basic exterior model
* Basic cockpit
* Control surface movement
* Major five instruments work (airspeed, AoA, altimeter, fuel, tachometer)
* Landing gear and floats

Features that are **not** included (but hopefully will be soon):

* Textured exterior
* Damping on AoA (or more realistic behaviour)
* Better FDM (the float/planing transition isn't great)
* Floats-only version (the real A5 will have this as an option as well)
* Attitude indicator instead of AoA indicator
* Fine-tuning of interior materials
* Complete cockpit controls (there aren't that many controls so this shouldn't take too long)
* Canopy open/close
* Parachute (for the entire plane)
* Side windows

Features that aren't included nor high priority:

* Folding wings. I mean, what can you do with folding wings?... :)
* Garmin aera 796 GPS unit. (Mostly because this will require a full touchscreen device emulator in Nasal...)
* Unfortunately, Rembrandt. My computer isn't fast enough for Rembrandt.
